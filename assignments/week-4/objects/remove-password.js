  - user should be a valid object with at least a username and password.
  - If password does not exist, return the object as it is.

  Function: removePassword
  Description: Removes the password property from the user object.

  @param {object} user - The user object containing user details.

  @returns {object} The updated user object without the password property.
*/

function removePassword(user) {
  if (typeof user !== 'object' || user === null || !user.username) {
    return 'Invalid user';
  }

  if (user.hasOwnProperty('password')) {
    delete user.password;
  }

  return user;
}

// Example usage
console.log(removePassword({username: 'Onkar', password: 'secret'})); // { username: 'Onkar' }
